A simple script to fix keyring issues preventing installs and updates

We've all done it; a few installs here, a few uninstalls there, and all the sudden you can't update due to mismatched keys. Fear not, for this simple shell script should fix these issues and allow you to continue on. I made this because I struggled to find the needed commands in the past and want to help other users resolve their issues quicker.
